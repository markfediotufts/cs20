    <p>I grew up in Brewster, New York. Brewster is about an hour drive
                north from New York City.</p>

        <p style="width: 200px; margin-left: 10px;">My favorite place is probably my dining room table because when we eat there, 
                                as opposed to a smaller table in our kitchen, it means my siblings are home. I am the youngest of 4
                                siblings who have all moved out, and so I don't get to see them regularly.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:left">Something no one would expect about me: </h2>
    <p style="width: 750px">The fact that my mom thinks I'm a quiet kid. I can understand her point of view because I have less
        to talk about compared to other people in my family (everyone else in my family has already been through
        college, they know what it's like), but I'm very loud when I'm with my friends so I don't think they'd
        expect my mom to think this.</p>
